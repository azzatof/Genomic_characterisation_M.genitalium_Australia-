# Quality Control of *Mycoplasma genitalium* sequence reads

### 1. Pre-filtering of Sequences

Local and global sequence have been pre-filtered to select for reads that only mapped to the G37 *Mycoplasma genitalium* G37 reference genome (N**C_000908.2**) using minimap2 (**v2.24**) and samtools (**v1.10**). 

Additionally all sequence reads underwent adapter trimming using Trimmomatic (v 0.39) prior to QC analysis to remove residual sequence adapters.
